## MODULE BASICS

In the ETHOS framework, a module is conceived as an autonomous, programmable unit that encapsulates a defined set of functions and an internal state. Each module serves as a sovereign execution node capable of maintaining its own memory, executing logic, and interacting within a broader modular network.

The state of a module refers to its internal memory—a collection of variables that persist locally within the module’s context. These variables evolve over time as a consequence of function executions and external interactions.

Functions within a module are defined as deterministic or probabilistic operations that act upon input parameters to produce specific outputs. These inputs are typically structured as keyword arguments or positional arguments, enabling flexible interfacing.

Every module is uniquely identified by a cryptographic key. This key not only authenticates the module's identity but also enables core cryptographic operations including signing, verification, encryption, and decryption, with support for secure algorithms such as sr25519 and AES-256.

For example, a key can be generated via the following invocation:

```bash
c get_key fam
```

Which returns an identity key object formatted for cryptographic use:

```bash
<Key(address=5Gs51y... crypto_type=sr25519)>
```

To invoke a function on the root module, one may simplify the call as follows:

```bash
c {fn} **params
```

This shorthand allows for seamless interaction with the system's core.

## CLIENT INTERACTION

Client-to-module interactions are governed by authenticated, signed requests. Each request specifies a URL that identifies the location of the target module, the name of the function to be executed, a set of parameters to be passed to that function, and a UTC timestamp.

The request is authenticated via a digital signature embedded within the request header. The header encodes a cryptographic hash of the URL, function, parameters, and timestamp. This hash is signed using the client’s private key, forming a verifiable proof of authenticity.

The header structure is outlined as follows:

```json
{
  "data": sha256(url + fn + params + time),
  "key": "<address>",
  "signature": "<sig>",
  "time": "<UTC>",
  "max_usage": 1.0
}
```

The body of the request follows the JSON-RPC protocol:

```json
{
  "url": "{ip}:{port}/{fn}",
  "params": { ... }
}
```

This structure ensures integrity, traceability, and accountability across all module interactions.

## TRANSACTION RECEIPTS

Upon successful execution of a function, the module returns a structured transaction receipt. This receipt captures the details of the execution, including the function name, input parameters, resulting output, computational cost, client header data, and a server-side signature validating the response.

```json
{
  "fn": "fn_name",
  "params": {...},
  "cost": 0.123,
  "result": {...},
  "client": {header...},
  "server": sign(fn + params + result + client)
}
```

These transactions are aggregated offchain and posted to the blockchain in batches at the conclusion of each epoch. During this reconciliation process, the client's stake is debited and the server is credited accordingly.

---

## COST GOVERNANCE

The ETHOS architecture incorporates a two-sided cost control mechanism. The server defines the computational cost for executing a given function, while the client specifies a `max_usage` parameter to enforce a ceiling on allowable expenditure.

This bilateral constraint model is designed to prevent exploitation or mispricing, thereby ensuring economic fairness and predictability in network operations.

---

## MODULE NETWORKS AND TREES

Modules in the ETHOS network are capable of forming hierarchical or graph-based networks, either onchain or offchain. In onchain configurations, these relationships are formalized through permissioned links that establish parent-child hierarchies.

A link is a formal connection between two modules and includes metadata such as profit-sharing ratios, optional aliases, and network descriptors. Links are unidirectional and require bilateral acceptance before activation. They may be used to route requests or to coordinate inter-module workflows.

```ascii
    Parent Module
         |
      [Link: 20%]
         |
    Child Module
```

## NETWORK TOPOLOGIES

Three primary topological patterns are supported within ETHOS:

**Replica Sets** represent homogeneous configurations where all child modules replicate the functionality of the parent. The parent routes calls deterministically to children based on predefined rules.

**Subnets** offer heterogeneous behavior. Here, child modules may vary in logic and compete for client requests. This design encourages diversity in output and supports probabilistic routing strategies.

**Recursive Trees** extend the above models by allowing any child module to function as a parent to additional children, forming arbitrarily deep hierarchical structures capable of modeling complex systems.

---

## CONSENSUS MECHANISMS

Each module is bound to a consensus module that mediates economic and trust-based logic. The default implementation, known as Consensus 0, provides escrow, staking, and dispute resolution mechanisms for transaction integrity.

Future consensus modules may include offchain zk-proofs or be designed to interoperate with other blockchain ecosystems. The overarching goal is to make consensus mechanisms modular, verifiable, and application-specific.

---

## STAKING FRAMEWORK

Staking is the foundational mechanism that governs access, influence, and reward allocation within the ETHOS network. A user's stake in a module determines their ability to call its functions, participate in governance, and share in revenue.

The reward function is defined as:

$\text{Reward}_{module} = \sum_{tx} \text{Cost}_{tx}$

Where the total reward is the aggregate cost of all valid transactions processed by the module.

---

## STRATEGIC VISION

ETHOS aspires to become a universal runtime for autonomous, cryptographically secure agents. In this architecture, each module operates as an independent, composable, and economically sovereign entity. Collectively, these modules form a scalable mesh of programmable services, capable of replacing conventional cloud and middleware architectures.

In the words of the ETHOS ethos:

> "The module is the unit of logic. The tree is the unit of trust."
