# PyPM - Python Process Manager

PyPM is a Python Process Manager inspired by PM2, designed to manage and monitor Python processes with a simple interface. It provides functionality for starting, stopping, restarting, and monitoring Python processes.

## Features

- Start, stop, restart, and delete processes
- Monitor process status, memory usage, and CPU usage
- Save and load process configurations
- View process logs
- Automatic process restarts
- File watching for development

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
import commune as c

# Initialize the process manager
pm = c.module('pm.pypm')

# Start a process
pm.start(fn='serve', name='my_server', module='server')

# List processes
processes = pm.list()
print(processes)

# View logs
logs = pm.logs('my_server', lines=100)
print(logs)

# Monitor processes in real-time
pm.monitor()

# Stop a process
pm.stop('my_server')

# Delete a process
pm.delete('my_server')
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Start a process with custom parameters
pm.start(
    fn='serve',
    name='custom_server',
    module='server',
    params={'port': 8080, 'debug': True},
    interpreter='python3.9',
    cwd='/path/to/project',
    env={'DEBUG': 'true'},
    max_restarts=10,
    watch=True,
    watch_delay=1000
)

# Save current process configuration
pm.save('my_config')

# Load a saved configuration
pm.load('my_config')

# Set up a startup configuration
pm.startup()

# Kill all processes
pm.kill_all()
```

## Integration with Commune

PyPM is designed to work seamlessly with the Commune framework, providing a simple interface for managing Python processes.

```python
# Import commune
import commune as c

# Start a server
c.pm.pypm.start(fn='serve', name='api_server')

# Monitor processes
c.pm.pypm.monitor()
```

## Comparison with PM2

PyPM is inspired by PM2 but is specifically designed for Python processes. While PM2 is a more general-purpose process manager for Node.js applications, PyPM focuses on Python-specific use cases and integrates with the Commune framework.

### Key Differences

- Python-native implementation
- Seamless integration with Commune
- Simplified API for Python processes
- Designed for Python-specific use cases
